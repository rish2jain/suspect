  "explanation": "Patty claims she drove to Lake Marion for a camping trip on Friday evening. But Clue 3 reveals the only road to Lake Marion was closed for bridge repairs starting Friday at noon — she couldn't have gone camping there. She lied about being away all weekend.

Clue 2 narrows the sabotage to Saturday morning.",
