  "explanation": "Diane claims she left the office at 7:30 PM. But Clue 1 reveals the office Wi-Fi log shows her personal phone stayed connected until 10:47 PM -- over three hours after she claims to have left. Since her phone never disconnected, she never actually left the building. Diane stayed late, used the hex wrench from the facilities closet (Clue 2) to install the lockbox, and then left after 10:47 PM. The re-entry at 9:15 PM in Clue 3 wasn't her -- she was already inside.",
  "funFact": "The ideal office temperature is hotly debated: studies range from 68 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit, and thermostat tampering is the most common 'office crime.'"
