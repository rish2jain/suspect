  "explanation": "Claudia claims she was on vacation all last week and implies the swap could have happened anytime. But Clue 3 shows her vault keycard was used Wednesday evening at 6:45 PM, and her Portland hotel check-in was not until Thursday afternoon -- she was still in town and accessed the vault the night before leaving.

She swapped the letter Wednesday evening, mailed the genuine one to herself, and left for Portland the next day.",
