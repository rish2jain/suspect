  "explanation": "Todd claims he spent Saturday afternoon driving to his parents' house in Riverside. But Clue 2 shows he badged into the office at 2:30 PM Saturday and didn't leave until 5:45 PM — he was at the office for over three hours on Saturday afternoon, not driving to Riverside.

Clue 1 shows the balloons were bought that same Saturday morning.",
  "funFact": "The largest office prank on record involved 28,000 sticky notes covering every surface of a coworker's cubicle — it took four people an entire weekend."
