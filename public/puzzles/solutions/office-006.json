  "culprit": "s1",
  "explanation": "Pete claims he was on back-to-back video calls starting at 8:30 AM, but Clue 3 reveals his first call didn't begin until 9:15 AM. He lied about his schedule to cover a forty-five minute window. Clue 2 shows decaf beans were purchased at 8:22 AM from across the street. Pete arrived at 8:15, had time to walk across the street, buy the decaf, swap the beans (Clue 1 -- grocery bag seen by 8:40), and return before his real first meeting at 9:15.",
  "funFact": "In blind taste tests, most people cannot tell the difference between regular and decaf coffee. The 'caffeine effect' is often partly placebo!"
